# Godot Stopwatch GDScript Implementation

This repo is meant to showcase an example of how to implement a flexible Stopwatch in GDScript for Godot 4 and will be the basis for a possible future built-in stopwatch implementation in Godot.

This repo includes a Stopwatch node written in GDScript for Godot 4 with the ability to pause and scale the time with `Engine.time_scale` or a custom coefficient, as well as format the time into user-friendly formats like the hh:mm:ss format. It also includes a simple test scene to see and test stopwatch and the time scaling.
